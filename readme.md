# Matthew Hammonds KPMG Coding Test #

## Please note that this readme and answer is not yet complete ##

Thank you for sending me a fun test featuring re-occurring loops and tree structures. However, sadly due to my limited time whilst job hunting and working full time, I have not yet managed to fully complete the challenge to a level with which I am satisfied. With that said, I wanted to show you that I am committed and excited by this opportunity, so I wanted to show you my current progress.

### Run Code ###

The only way to run the function is by running the test file using the node command below. I intend to build a command-line instruction to attach your input/ inputs file.

`node test.js`

### Current Known Bugs & Refactoring Todo's ###

* Remove the need for `output` varible and tree `varible` as this will be done in one nested re-occuring loop
* Child nodes are not yet ordered according to `previousSiblingId`
* Merge all parent and sibling instructions into single re-occuring loop: `update_in_nested_array()`
* Create node-js file system opener for KPMG to add input / inputs file through command line
* Write result to `./output/output.json`
